# Hello everyone!

:star2: If you are reading this document then I'm assuming that you are interested in contributing to the iwant-bot project. This project is made by kiwi.com interns. All contributions are welcome: new use-cases, code, patches, bugfixes, issues, etc. 
This is just set of guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes in a pull request.


# Ways to contribute

  - At first, check existing [issues](https://github.com/kiwicom/iwant-bot/issues) and our pull requests and help us with development with your proposed solution or improvement
  - [Create own issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), if you think you have a good idea and let us consider your contribution
  - To report a bug:
      - Open an issue with label "bug" :bug:
      - Describe expected behavior
      - Describe an actual, incorrect behavior
      - It would be great if a pull with possible solution came along with a report
  - You can create your own [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on [Github](https://github.com/kiwicom/iwant-bot)

- Reference issues and pull requests liberally
- When only changing documentation, include __[ci skip]__ in the commit description
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance

- Keep in mind that commit messages are mainly for the other people, so they should be understandable even after six months
- If you use _git revert_ or undoing commit, default commit message specify which commit you want to revert, but it is not enough to know __why__ you are undoing it, please add more comments to it
#### Example
> ':emoji:' or tag: Short explanation of the commit
>
> Longer explanation which explaining what and why is changed, what bugs or issues were fixed and not too brief further description
> 
> Issue reference - you should use 'Fixes' keyword if your commit fixes a bug, or 'Closes' keyword if your commit 
> adds a feature or enhancement
>
>You should add full URL to the issue Â e.g. Closes https://github.com/kiwicom/iwant-bot/issues/13
